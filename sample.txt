Git commands even a monkey can understand.
They're using a TortoiseGit and I'm using Git Bash- It's going to be a long ride!
Guess what? I had to first type 'git init' so as to create a git repo in my working tree/directory
Yeah, you'll see in your working folder/file as a .git folder depending on what path of files you typed
the command 'git init'.
Then, I typed the command 'git status' before and after making some changes to you (sample.txt)
BEFORE: The message I got on my git bash terminal was no commits yet, then changes to be committed line.
AFTER (adding some lines/text on you):I got the before lines and a new line that states 'changes not staged for commit'.

REMEMBER: A commit is just like a recording of the changes you've made to your file.

Then after, I used the command 'git add sample.txt' which added you to the staging area i.e a place you can wait till I record
you the desired changes I made. (Awesome).

Then, I finally recorded the changes I made to you by using the 'git commit' command. (Yippie)
Ooooh yeah, one more thing: all this I did in my local repo :).
I hope this is getting added.
Okay two more commands in practice 'git clone' - just makes a copy of the original file
                                   'git push' - uploading your local repo to a remote repo e.g github
